# Customer Churn Prediction & Decision Dashboard

## Overview

### This project implements an end-to-end machine learning system for predicting customer churn and translating model predictions into actionable business decisions.

### Instead of stopping at churn probability estimation, the system answers a practical business question:

## Should the company intervene for a given customer, and is the intervention economically justified?

### The project includes:

### Data preprocessing and feature engineering

### Training and comparison of multiple ML models

### Model explainability

### A production-style Streamlit web application

### A configurable cost–benefit decision framework
